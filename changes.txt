Changes in version 1.1 (02 July 2005)

- irrxml is now also able to parse embedded text correctly when it is shorter than
  2 characters. 
  
- irrxml now treats whitespace quite intelligent and doesn't report it when it is
  obviously used for formatting the xml file. (Text won't be reported when it only contains
  whitespace and is shorter than 3 characters)
  
- irrxml won't crash anymore when the xml file is malformatted and an attribute has
  an opening but no closing attribute.
  
- Removed a documentation which claimed that the xml parser doesn't work as the xml standard
  when replacing special characters, which wasn't true.
